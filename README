I can insure that my program is functional by running tests, such as JUnit, to ensure each method passes all error throws and logical tests.
You can ensure security by running dependency checks on a program, which will respond with imports that may be flawed and could lead to unsecure code.
I can interpret customers needs into program form by creating a flow chart to lay out the programs needs before developing.
I approach designing software by getting the clients needs, making diagrams on how the program should be layed out and function, then start programming.
